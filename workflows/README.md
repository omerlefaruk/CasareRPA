# CasareRPA Workflows

This directory stores saved workflow files in JSON format.

Workflows created in the visual editor will be automatically saved here.

## File Format

Workflows are saved as `.json` files using the following schema:
- Workflow metadata (name, version, author)
- Node definitions and properties
- Connection/edge information
- Execution settings

---

Example workflows will be added during Phase 6 development.

This category contains **12** nodes.


| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [BreakNode](break-node.md) | Loop control node that exits from the current loop. |
| [CatchNode](catch-node.md) | Catch block for handling errors from the Try block. |
| [ContinueNode](continue-node.md) | Loop control node that skips to next iteration. |
| [FinallyNode](finally-node.md) | Finally block - always executes after Try/Catch regardless of errors. |
| [ForLoopEndNode](for-loop-end-node.md) | End node of a For Loop pair (ForLoopStart + ForLoopEnd). |
| [ForLoopStartNode](for-loop-start-node.md) | Start node of a For Loop pair (ForLoopStart + ForLoopEnd). |
| [IfNode](if-node.md) | Conditional node that executes different paths based on condition. |
| [MergeNode](merge-node.md) | Merge node that allows multiple execution paths to converge. |
| [SwitchNode](switch-node.md) | Multi-way branching node based on value matching. |
| [TryNode](try-node.md) | Try block for error handling. |
| [WhileLoopEndNode](while-loop-end-node.md) | End node of a While Loop pair (WhileLoopStart + WhileLoopEnd). |
| [WhileLoopStartNode](while-loop-start-node.md) | Start node of a While Loop pair (WhileLoopStart + WhileLoopEnd). |

# Plan: Merge worktrees

## Goals
- Merge worktree branches into a main-based integration branch.
- Review combined changes and fix issues.
- Update docs/rules to satisfy coupling requirements.
- Verify with tests and report QA status.

## Steps
1. Create integration worktree from main and run baseline tests.
2. Merge worktree branches and resolve any conflicts.
3. Review diffs, fix issues, and update docs/rules as needed.
4. Run QA checks/tests and summarize outcomes.

# System Status Report (Final)
Generated by Antigravity

## System Health
- [x] **Orchestrator**: ONLINE (Restored Database Access on port 6543)
- [ ] **Robot Agent**: OFFLINE (Blocked by Supabase Circuit Breaker)
- [x] **Configuration**: FIXED (Clean .env generated)

## Diagnostics
The Orchestrator is successfully communicating with the database (as verified by the API returning 0 robots instead of an error). However, the Robot agent is still being rejected by the database server (`Circuit breaker open`), likely due to a stuck connection pool or lingering IP ban specific to its connection pattern.

## Action Plan
1. **Wait ~15-20 minutes** for the server to clear the connection ban.
2. Run `launch.bat`.
3. Verify by running: `python tests/e2e/test_full_execution.py` should show "Found 1 robots, 1 ONLINE".
